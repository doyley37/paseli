                We have reserved the entire hotel for our wedding weekend. Since we're on the hook
                for any rooms not taken, we'd prefer if you could book your stay in this hotel ♥️
            </p>
                <strong>PLEASE DO NOT BOOK YOUR ROOM YET.</strong>
            <p>
                We have guests with drastically differerent needs and want to make sure that the
                bigger rooms go to people that need to travel with kids first.
            </p>
            <p>
                After you RSVP'ed, we will reach out to you and let you know when you can book your
                room.
