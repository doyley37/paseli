      We first met in the gym but only started talking on the boat of a common
      friend. We enjoyed the sun, water, and a cringey portion of dad jokes.
      Hey, in Pascal's defense: Elisabetta started with them.

      It all started innocently by just watching the British show 'Catastrophe'.
      Unlike Pascal's usual dates this was very much not a catastrophe. And soon
      after, we realized we liked each other more than we thought.

      For Elisabetta's birthday, Pascal and Elisabetta went on their first motorcycle
      ride together. Or maybe that was really a present for Pascal? 🤔

      Unfortunately, Pascal's mum was on her last legs due to a decade long fight
      with cancer. We decided to go together. While it wasn't exactly a
      vacation, Pascal is incredibly thankful that his mum got to meet Elisabetta.
      And her mum very much approved of her.

      We waited a while before we told the kids because we needed to be sure
      that we could be one big family. Our kids had already gone through several
      big changes over the last years. Thankfully they liked the idea very much:
      not only did they like each other, they also liked their soon-to-be
      step-parents. And maybe—just maybe—the promise of ice cream made everything
      even better!

      Pascal finally got his act together and proposed to Elisabetta. In the spirit
      of doing things differently, he did it during a camping trip with the kids
      while kneeling in a rocky riverbed. Hey, we're living in the pacific
      northwest. Sadly, Pascal failed to secure sponsorship from REI.

      We realized getting married this year would make our lives easier. At
      the same time, we wanted a proper wedding. So we decided to do both:
      Doing a small court house ceremony this year and planning a big wedding
      for next year. Sometimes you can have your cake and eat it too 💍 🍰
