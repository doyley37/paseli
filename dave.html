                During our trip to the Ape Caves our three daughters mentioned
                that they wish they had a brother. Finja joked that they did,
                but we lost him in the caves. "What? Who was that?" Avery asked.
                Finja explained that his name was "Dave", and while losing him
                was sad, we at least managed to bring 75% of our children home
                safely.

                Now whenever we go anywhere, it's a running joke that we left
                Dave behind.
